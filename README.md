M1 X8 Factory
A modular research-oriented architecture designed for structured development,

experimentation, and component-level modeling.

This repository provides an organized environment for:

• Layered system design

• Modular component separation

• Structured data organization

• Configurable architecture

• Extensible analytical modules

• Isolated development branches

The project focuses on maintainability, clarity, and scalability of structure,

allowing future expansion and controlled evolution of components.

Structure Overview
The repository contains several conceptual layers, organized to support:

• Independent modules

• Configurable files

• Abstract processing blocks

• Separated analytical components

• Expandable architecture layout

No assumptions are made about use‑case, execution, behavioral logic, or operational context.

All modules are provided as a structural foundation only.

Branching Model
• main — Primary, stable version of the structure

• engine-dev — Development and extension area

Notes
This repository does not describe, document, or imply any operational behavior.

No execution flow, processing logic, or functional characteristics are included.

All descriptions are intentionally abstract and limited to structural concepts only.
